## Technical Configuration Details

### üîë Contact-Based Authentication Architecture
```yaml
# Core Authentication Pattern
UserIdentification: user.contactid (NOT user.systemuserid)
RoleBasedFiltering: Contact table with enhanced fields
BusinessUnitAccess: cr129_businessunitname lookup field
AccessLevels: Own Process (100000000), Business Unit (100000001), Cross BU (100000002)
```

### üìä Dataverse Integration Patterns
```yaml
# Successful Table Integrations
cr129_assess: Assessment records with Contact-based filtering
cr129_proc: Process records with ownership and business unit display
cr129_contact: Enhanced with role, business unit, and access level fields

# Choice Field Handling
StatusComparison: record.cr129_status.value (numeric)
StatusDisplay: record.cr129_status.label (text)
RoleValues: Analyst=100000000, Manager=100000001, Executive=100000002

# FetchXML Best Practices
FilteringPattern: Contact-based with role-dependent logic
AttributeSelection: Primary key + display fields + lookup fields + audit fields
OrderingPattern: Consistent sorting by display name
```

### üéØ Role-Based Data Access
- **Analyst Role (100000000):** See only own records (cr129_assessor = user.contactid)
- **Manager Role (100000001):** See all records in business unit
- **Executive Role (100000002):** See all records in business unit
- **Process Ownership:** cr129_processowner field for process-specific access

### Web Roles Configuration
- **Authenticated Users:** adx_authenticatedusersrole: true (auto-assigned)
- **RCSA App User:** Main application role
- **Role-Based Filtering:** Connected to process access levels

## üéØ Successfully Integrated Pages

### Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)
- **Real-time Assessment Metrics:** Total, Completed, In Progress, Challenged counts
- **Role-Based Filtering:** Analysts see own assessments, Managers see business unit assessments
- **Status Handling:** Proper choice field value mapping (Draft=0, Submitted=1, Challenged=2, Agreed=3)
- **DateTime Formatting:** Consistent date display using .NET format strings
- **Debug Information:** Comprehensive user context and data debugging

### Process Selection Page (`/process-selection`)
- **Dynamic Process Loading:** Real-time data from cr129_proc table
- **Business Unit Display:** Shows business unit for each process
- **Process Ownership:** Filters by cr129_processowner field
- **Criticality Badges:** Visual indicators for process criticality levels
- **Selection Functionality:** Working process selection with session storage
- **Navigation Integration:** Proper routing to Risk Identification page

## Business Unit Strategy (MVP Approach)

### Self-Selection Implementation
- **Data Source:** cr129_bu table
- **Default Access:** 'own process' level
- **User Choice:** First-login business unit selection
- **Access Levels:**
  - **Analyst:** Own processes only
  - **Manager:** Business unit processes
  - **Executive:** All processes

### Role-Based Process Filtering
- Integrated with existing cr129_proc table
- Leverages cr129_proc_businessunitname_cr129_bu lookup
- Supports hierarchical access control
